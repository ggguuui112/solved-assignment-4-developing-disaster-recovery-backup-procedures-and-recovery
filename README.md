<strong>Introduction </strong>

When disaster strikes a business, executive management expects its IT team has a recovery plan prepped and ready to go. A successful recovery hinges in part on whether IT has properly tested its plan and regularly updated it. Recovery speed is also key.

The purpose of a business continuity and disaster recovery plan is to document all identified mission-critical IT systems, applications, and data recovery procedures. Fast recovery times for IT systems and applications are achievable with efficient and accurate recovery instructions.

In this lab, you will apply the same concepts of disaster recovery backup procedures and recovery instructions to your own data. You will explain how you can lower recovery time objectives (RTOs) with proper backup and recovery procedures, you will define a process for IT system and application recovery procedures, you will identify a backup solution for saving your own data, and you will test and verify your backups for RTO compliance.

<strong>Learning Objectives </strong>

Upon completing this lab, you will be able to:

Explain how to lower RTO with properly documented backup and recovery steps.

Define a process for IT system and application recovery procedures.

Identify a backup solution for saving an Assignment Assessment Worksheet.

Test and validate your basic backup and recovery procedures for saving a Lab Assessment Worksheet.

Test the backup and recovery procedures for RTO compliance.

 <li>In your Lab Report file, <strong>write </strong>the backup procedures and recovery procedures you used.</li>

</ol>

<strong><u>Note:</u></strong>

Arguably, the most important section of any business continuity plan is the Procedures section. A business can plan disaster recovery scenarios extensively, carefully weighing all possible risk likelihood and impacts. However, without detailed procedures with which to execute the recovery, a business will not resume operations efficiently, if at all. And this is especially true in times of near-panic and extreme “executive oversight” immediately following a disaster. The key source for documenting accurate and helpful recovery procedures is testing.

<strong>Assignment #4 – Assessment Worksheet- Developing Disaster Recovery Backup Procedures and Recovery Instructions</strong>

<strong><em>Overview </em></strong>

In this lab, you applied the same concepts of disaster recovery backup procedures and recovery instructions to your own data. You explained how you can lower recovery time objectives (RTOs) with proper backup and recovery procedures, you defined a process for IT system and application recovery procedures, you identified a backup solution for saving your own data, and any ways that you tested and verified your backups for RTO compliance.
